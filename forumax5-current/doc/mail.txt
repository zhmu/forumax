How to integrate ForuMAX 5.0 Private Messaging with qmail
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

WARNING: This is only designed for expert users who are very familiar with
	 general UNIX system administration, PHP, Perl, MySQL and qmail. This
	 information is provided as an 'as-is' base and is not supported by
	 ForuMAX.

1) Install these Perl modules:

- MailTools, at http://search.cpan.org/search?dist=MailTools
- DBI, at http://search.cpan.org/search?dist=DBI
- Msql-Mysql-modules, at http://search.cpan.org/search?dist=Msql-Mysql-modules
- MIME-Base64, at http://www.cpan.org/authors/id/GAAS/MIME-Base64-2.12.tar.gz
- IO-stringy, at http://www.cpan.org/authors/id/ERYQ/IO-stringy-2.108.tar.gz
- MIME-tools, at http://cpan.valueclick.com/authors/Eryq/MIME-tools-5.411a.tar.gz

2) Create a virtual domain for the domain you want to handle forum email. You
   must create an appropriate Mail eXchanger DNS record for this domain too and
   add it to /var/qmail/control/rcpthosts and /var/qmail/control/virtualdomains.
   More information at http://cr.yp.to/qmail/faq/incominghost.html#virtual

3) Edit the 'forumax_qmail_gateway.pl' script in this package, and change
   $DB_HOSTNAME, $DB_DBNAME, $DB_USERNAME, $DB_PASSWORD as needed.

4) Copy the 'forumax_qmail_gateway.pl' script to where you want it to be,
   for example /var/qmail/bin/forumax_qmail_gateway.pl, and chmod it to
   700. Chown it to the user which will run the script.

5) Create a .qmail-default file for this domain, which will catch all email
   sent to this domain. The contents must be

   |/var/qmail/bin/forumax_qmail_gateway.pl

   In which /var/qmail/bin is whatever path you installed the script in.

6) Restart qmail by sending qmail-send a HUP signal. Congrats, it should now
   work!
