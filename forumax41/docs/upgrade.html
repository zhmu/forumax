This document will describe how to upgrade ForuMAX.<p>

<b>Upgrading ForuMAX</b><br>
Upgrading ForuMAX is much easier than installing it. All you have to do is copy all files, <b><u>except forum_options.pl</u></b> from the <code>cgi-bin</code> directory to the cgi-bin directory of the forum. That's it.<p>

<b>Notice</b> If you are upgrading from any version before 4.0 to 4.0, you will also need to do the stuff below:<p>

1) Create an empty file called <code>groups</code> in the internal ForuMAX directory. It must have the same owner and permissions as <code>accounts</code> has.<br>
2) Edit <code>forum_options.pl</code>, and add the following:<p>

<code>
$GROUPDB_FILE=qq~<i>Complete directory and filename to your groups file</i>~;<br>
$GROUPDB_LOCKFILE=qq~<i>Complete directory and filename to your groups file, but add .LOCK to it</i>~;
</code><p>

When you are in the CP, immediately submit the options, and it'll be fine.<p>

<b>Notice</b> If you are upgrading from 4.0 to 4.1, you will also need to check the <i>Rebuild moderator list</i> checkbox in the Control Panel. This only needs to be done once.<p>

Good luck, and please enjoy ForuMAX!<br>
